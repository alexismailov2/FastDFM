# FastDTM
Repo for MCMC based Dynamic Topic Model.

This code has Eigen dependency. Before running this code, please make sure you update the CMakeLists to include the Eigen directory. All of this research was done at Tsinghua University in the [TSAIL](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) group.

### To-do list

- [ ] Multithreaded implementation.
- [X] Create Python wrapper for the code for easier usage. (Done pybind11_module)
- [ ] Create a DTM python module that can be easily pip installed.
